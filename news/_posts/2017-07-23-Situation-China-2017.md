## Current Situation in China

1. MHL has been enacted for four years
    - Misuse of involuntary hospitalisation enforced by the State/Police reduced but there are still cases;
    - Involuntary hospitalisation enforced by parents/guardian/family members is still there, and there are cases that many persons were forced to admitted their commitment were "voluntary".
    - The criteria of the Dangerousness is still evaluated and implemented by psychiatrists (not other parties or professions).

2. Main Obstacles:
    - There are quite a lot mental institutions that do not implement or amend their internal regulations in compliance with MHL (even four years later). Many persons living in the hospitals encountered the abuse of their rights. That needs constant monitoring.
    - Main opposite parties are law experts and family members, not even the State/govs. It's hard to persuade the law makers on the top to reform the (adult) guardianship system to be compliant with CRPD.
    - The goverments are planning to build more mental institutions, without listening to the society/comunity.
    - Lacking knowledge of independent living in community (and/or post-hospitalisation) is still the most serious hurdle for go forward to deinstitutionalisation. That is, many persons being able to discharge from hospital, and many supporters/workers do not have sufficient knowledge/skills to deal with post-hospital community life appropriately.

3. Work done and doing:
    - Newly joint self-advocates (while they are still few); A DPO of PPSD was formed and is doing some publicity work and self-helping; Another self-advocate is preparing his new organisation.
    - Organise the community to do some case rescueing.
    - advocating against the reform of the adult guardianship system inside the Civil Code being amending (but hard to make our suggestion included in there);
    - There could be an issue of motivation and sustainability of them to do something, thus we can do more; while there are a few of adult of children in disability to participate for the issue.

4. Needs proposed:
    - CRPD training
    - international gathering, is an important incentive for self-advocates and the community; also, to see each other is vital to the community leader.
    - Experiences on post-hospitalisation / return-to-community support.
    - Lacking lanuage ability is still one of the obstacles for community leaders to go international.
