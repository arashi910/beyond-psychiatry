> This is an interesting case as it shows (again) the fact that it is still very easy to commit a so-called 'patient' to a psychiatric hospital in China, even today.  

Lily, a woman with a diagnosis of depression, went to see psychiatrist in Baiyun Psychiatric Hospital 'companied' by her boyfriend's colleagues. The psychiatrist made diagnosis of her by only asking some questions to those two people accompanied about her conditions. Further, one of the man accompanied signed on the Informed Consent Paper for Involuntary Commitment for Lily. As a result, Lily was sent into the isolated ward of that hospital for at least three months (since December of 2017).  

As usual, Lily and the men who commit her, have different telling of the story. Lily said she was cheated to come to see the doctor without knowing where to go with her boyfriend's colleagues. But the men denied this.

The most interesting thing here is that the psychiatrist listened to the men who commit her only, and made diagnosis based on such limited information without any investigation. Hence, the psychiatrist(s)(maybe more than one) issued the informed consent paper to these two men and accepted their signatures. 

According to Mental Health Law which was launched in 2013, only guardians (who primarily are the close relatives) of the 'patient' have the privileges to approve the involuntary commitment and discharge of the 'patient' who is diagnosed to be 'dangerous' by psychiatrist

Obviously, the psychiatrists in Baiyun Hospital violated the law. Recently the administrative department of local authority issued an order to the hospital asking them to correct their medical behavior and urging them to regulate their 'professional' procedure.
